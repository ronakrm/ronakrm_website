			<h1>Finding Differentially Covarying Needles in a Temporally Evolving Haystack: A Scan Statistics Perspective</h1>
			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>Recent results in coupled or temporal graphical models offer schemes for estimating the relationship structure 
between features when the data come from
related (but distinct) longitudinal sources. A novel application of these ideas is for analyzing group-level differences, i.e., in identifying if the <em>trends</em> of the estimated objects (e.g., 
covariance or precision matrices) are different across disparate conditions (e.g., gender or disease). Often, poor effect sizes make detecting the <em>differential</em> signal 
over the <em>full</em> set of features difficult: for example, 
dependencies between only a <em>subset of features</em> may manifest differently across groups, as we will find in 
data from a unique longitudinally followed (since 2001) cohort of <em>healthy</em> individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
In this work, we first give a parametric model 
for estimating trends in the space of SPD matrices as a function of one or more covariates. We then generalize scan statistics to graph structures, 
to search over distinct subsets of features (graph partitions) whose temporal dependency structure may show statistically 
significant group-wise differences.
%We show how bounding the complexity of the size of distinct 
%subsets leads to a correction for multiple testing.
We theoretically analyze the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and bounds on Type 1 and Type 2 error. 
On a cohort of "young elderly" individuals with risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (but otherwise cognitively healthy), 
we find scientifically interesting 
group differences where the default analysis, i.e., models estimated on the <em>full graph</em>, do not survive reasonable 
significance thresholds.
