			<h1>Home</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Ronak Mehta's homepage! The main purpose of this site is to showcase a few projects I've worked on and give me a chance to gain some experience with web development.</p>
			<p>I am currently taking CS 761: Advanced Machine Learning and CS 766: Computer Vision. I am also a teaching assistant for CS 76O: Machine Learning this semester.</p>
			<p>The website is still currently a work in progress. Eventually everything will look good and all of the content will be up!</p>
